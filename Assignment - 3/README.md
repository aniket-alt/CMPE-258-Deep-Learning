# Basic Neural Network using NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow (Colab + GitHub)

This repository contains multiple Google Colab notebooks implementing a **3-layer deep neural network for non-linear regression**, progressively using:
- **Part A:** NumPy only (from scratch, manual backpropagation using chain rule, `einsum`)
- **Part B:** PyTorch from scratch (no built-in layers, manual weights + `einsum`)
- **Part C:** PyTorch class/module-based (`nn.Module`, layers, optimizer)
- **Part D:** PyTorch Lightning version
- **Part E:** TensorFlow implementations (low-level → built-in layers → functional API → high-level API)

> **Submission requirements covered:** clean GitHub repo, public access, clear documentation, loss vs epochs plots, final results, and video walkthrough links.
