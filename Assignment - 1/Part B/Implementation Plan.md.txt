Pomodoro Timer Implementation Plan
Goal Description
Allow users to directly edit the timer display to set custom durations, effectively replacing the specific "Custom" mode tab.

User Review Required
UX Change: The main timer display will become an editable input field.
Feature Removal: The "Custom" tab and its settings will be removed.
Proposed Changes
Frontend Structure
[MODIFY] 
index.html
Remove "Custom" button from .mode-tabs.
Remove "Custom (minutes)" input from Settings modal.
Change #time from <span> to <input type="text"> (or styled contenteditable) to allow direct entry.
[MODIFY] 
styles.css
Remove .custom-mode styling.
Style #time (now an input) to look like plain text (no border, background) but show visual feedback on focus/hover.
[MODIFY] 
script.js
Remove custom mode state and logic.
Add event listeners to the new #time input:
Focus: Pause timer (if running). Select all text.
Blur/Enter: Validate and parse input.
If integer (e.g. "20"), treat as minutes.
If "MM:SS", parse min/sec.
Update timeLeft and totalTime.
Update visuals (
updateDisplay
 called with new values).
Verification Plan
Manual Verification
Open App. Verify "Custom" tab is gone.
Click on the time "25:00". It should become editable.
Type "40" and press Enter.
Display should change to "40:00".
Timer should remain paused (or ready to start).
internal state timeLeft is 2400 seconds.
Click Start. Timer counts down from 40:00.
Verify Break modes still work and are editable too (implied feature consistency).
